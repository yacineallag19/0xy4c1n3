    Title: What's up folks
    Content: I am Allag Ahmed Yacine, a 4th-year Software Engineering student at ESI Algiers, a CTF player with @TroJeun and a cybersecurity enthusiast, however I wouldn't call it the only IT branch I am passionate about. I have a lot of interest in many other fields, generally, anything people struggle to understand. I will be sharing here blogs about my projects, my writeups for CTF challenges and thoughts.
